And how is it that life has been going well for her for four billion years? Why has it actually evolved into such a complex form that it can read even these lines?\n\nIn the amazing program The Birth of Planet Earth, we follow in the footsteps of creation - we take a look at the kitchen, in which not only the Sun but the entire solar system was boiled. What basic ingredients were used?\n\nThe story also tells where water and other substances rich in carbon, nitrogen or oxygen came from on Earth. We know that life could have evolved thanks to an exceptional trick: to capture light and turn it into life-giving energy. But is the Earth one of countless worlds abounding in life, or a miracle of a remarkable harmony of chemistry and physics? On the best visualization so far, we will also see how the guide of our planet - the silver moon - was created.\n\nThe Birth of Earth uses advanced visualizations based on astronomical observations and the latest findings from scientists across industries such as physics, geology and biology. The performance includes a tour of the starry sky - a demonstration of several bright stars, the most conspicuous constellations and of course the Moon. Speaked by Ondřej Novák.","short_desc":"CANCELED","link":"http://vstupenky.hvezdarna.cz/incoming.aspx?mrsid=2&eventid=31990","options":["suitable from 8 years","performance length: 50 minutes","2D (classic) performance in the digital hall","English audio available"]},{"name":"Universe 3D","price":"150/180","time":1587916800,"desc":"Let's play to ancient discoverers.
